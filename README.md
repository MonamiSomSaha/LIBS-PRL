# LIBS-PRL: Deep Learning for Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy Analysis

A deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) data for elemental composition and plasma parameter prediction.

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for analyzing LIBS spectroscopic data using deep neural networks. The system predicts elemental concentrations and plasma parameters from spectral measurements, enabling automated quantitative analysis of material composition.

## Features

- **Multi-element Analysis**: Simultaneous prediction of 5 elemental concentrations (Al, Fe, Cu, Ca, Au)
- **Plasma Parameter Estimation**: Prediction of electron temperature (Te) and electron density (Ne)
- **CNN Architecture**: 1D Convolutional Neural Network optimized for spectral data analysis
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Comprehensive simulation of LIBS spectra with controlled parameters
- **Multi-output Regression**: Simultaneous prediction of multiple targets with shared feature extraction

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model uses a 1D CNN architecture specifically designed for spectroscopic data:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts spectral intensity data
- **Convolutional Layers**: Feature extraction with batch normalization
- **Global Average Pooling**: Dimensionality reduction
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with dropout for regularization
- **Multiple Outputs**: Separate heads for concentrations, temperature, and electron density

## Usage

1. **Data Generation**: The notebook generates synthetic LIBS spectral data with known elemental compositions and plasma parameters
2. **Preprocessing**: Spectral data is normalized and prepared for neural network training
3. **Model Training**: The CNN is trained using multi-output regression with early stopping and learning rate reduction
4. **Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using RMSE, RÂ², and MAE metrics for each output

**Note**: This implementation uses synthetic data for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, the model would need to be trained and validated with experimental LIBS spectral data.
